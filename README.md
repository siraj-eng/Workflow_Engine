# Workflow Simulator

A simple **workflow simulator** that models how tasks progress through different stages of a process.  
Useful for learning how automation systems handle transitions, approvals, and status updates.

## 🚀 Features
- Simulates task or process flow through multiple stages  
- Supports manual or automatic transitions  
- Clear console-based visualization of state changes  
- Lightweight and easy to extend for real-world systems

## 🧠 Purpose
This project helps developers understand workflow logic, process automation, and state management — the foundation of systems like ticket trackers, project managers, and approval pipelines.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- C# / .NET  
- Object-Oriented Design principles  
- Console simulation architecture

## 💡 Usage
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open in Visual Studio or any C# IDE  
3. Run the program to observe the workflow simulation  
4. Modify states or transitions to experiment with custom flows
